<p class="detail-text">Terminus is an online text-based adventure game that teaches the player how to use terminal commands. The terminal and text-based adventure interfaces are very similar, making the transition from game to product more seamless than before. Gamification! Project designed, coded, and decorated by Shawn Conrad, Michaela LaVan,Michele Pratusevich, Emma Tolley, David Zhou. </p>
<p class="detail-text">Making it to the semifinals of the MIT iCampus Prize Competition in spring 2013, Terminus provides a solution to a freshman problem at MIT: the computing environment is Ubuntu Linux, and there are many custom commands on the MIT Debathena Computing system that incoming freshmen are not familiar with. By playing Terminus, they can become more familiar with both the command-line environment and the MIT computing environment.</p>
