<p class="detail-text">iRephotography is an iOS app (mainly for iPad) that lets someone take a photo from exactly the same point a second time. iRephotography was my SuperUROP project senior year in Fall-Spring of 2012-2013. I worked with Professor Fredo Durand and was directly supervised by Abe Davis in the Graphics Group.</p>
