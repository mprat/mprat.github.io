Goal: TAs take ownership of their own new job. 

TA training (TA preparation? a la instructor prep vs instructor training) - these are the topics we covered (in scenario, act-them-out-as-you-see-fit form during the training week in the summer)
(1) Speak slow
(2) Use simple words
(3) Dealing with lots of questions
(4) Tackling boredom / tiredness
(5) Students not participating
(6) Students stressing a lot
We did skits, then we  had a great discussion about each of these topics. The goal was more to get them aware and thinking about these topics rather than giving them a manual about how to do it right.

I also wanted to do 10 minutes of an instructor practice-teaching, with a TA practicing being a TA at the time, and everyone else be students. But this was ambitious because we didn't have enough instructors.

Heh. The way I ran the session is like this: 
* Write all those scenarios on the board. Have the TAs choose the one they want to start with. Split into two groups, tell them to split among themselves who is an instructor / TA / student (if you have around 4 people then just do it in one group), and have them run through the scenario as realistically as they possibly could, playing their appointed role. 
* What generally happens is that something interesting happens - your role is to remind them to REALLY play their role, not be thinking about the system. When they've done this for a few minutes and something reasonable happens that simulates a real classroom, stop. 
* Have a discussion focused on the following questions: 
1) How did each person-group feel? (instructor, TA, student) What was missing from your experience? 
2) What (do you think) went well?
3) What (do you think) went poorly?
4) What are our takeaways as a TA group? Is there something I need to personally work on.

The topics I gave you were basically starting topics of discussion. My goal is to in general get THEM to think about what it's like to be a TA and the things that go unnoticed in the classroom. Basically put themselves in different shoes. Doing /anything/ that gets them to come up with any conclusions about how to act in a classroom on their own is the best. There is really no "right answer", and referring them to Sadek is giving them yet another yet. Having THEM come up with "effective tactics" and "good things for a TA to do" means that THEY came up with it, and they don't have to be policed by someone like Sadek. 

Kind of the ideal is that the discussion they have yields something like 5 "bullet points for good TA behavior" that becomes their teaching "contract" so to speak. But that's kind of optimistic, and I was satisfied with a serious discussion. I tried really hard to let them (and especially returning TAs) guide the discussion, with me jumping in when someone dominated conversation or staying on track or something.

Does that make sense?
