I live in an East Jerusalem, I work in West Jerusalem, I speak only English, and I have both Israeli and Palestinian friends. My mother is scared for me, my boyfriend makes sure to message me as often as he can, and instead of reading my usual Reddit or HackerNews, I read Haaretz, BBC, and any other media I can find. I am living in Jerusalem but my closest contacts are still abroad, and my media biases are in the West.

The current situation in the eyes of the West has escalated to a full-out war. In the West (among my loved ones back in the States who are worried about me), it seems that my life is in danger day to day. It seems like things can go from bad to worse in seconds, and it seems that there is no question that I should immediately come home. I disagree. 

I come to the MEET office and am immediately immersed in what we do - we give youth tools for evaluating their future.


I see both of these things in the same hour, and I feel like I am doing an important task by working at MEET, encouraging at least mutual understanding.  












Given the current escalation in Gaza, I still choose to be in Jerusalem and with MEET, moreso than ever. As someone who is neither Israeli or Palestinian, I am pulled in a million directions at once while being confused about what is "right" and what is "wrong", if such a thing exists. I want to share my personal experience with you, for better or for worse. 

My neighborhood is close to the Old City of Jerusalem, technically considered East Jerusalem. My street is in the back alleys, so no violence reaches where I am, but the sights and sounds from Damascus Gate and around the Old City are often heard (not only when there are problems). There are no riots, but every evening there is an army and police presence at the entrances to the neighborhood. Walking home from the MEET office to my apartment, I would see on the same walk protesters holding signs in Hebrew saying "Death to Arabs" and would be given flyers by others saying "Boycott Israel". To me the situation in Gaza seems far away - the rockets do not fall on Iron-Dome-protected Jerusalem. I sit at home listening to fireworks at night with a mix of emotions - could the fireworks be for Ramadan? Could the smoke near Damascus gate be celebratory smoke bombs? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Last night the fireworks were celebrating Hamas's capture of an Israeli soldier, in hopes for a Palestinian prisoner exchange. The smoke was a crowd-dispersal method, and the occasional rocket siren is another cause for celebration. I see groups of young boys walking side by side with M16-wielding solders, not wanting confrontation. My situational awareness is constantly turned on, confident I can go somewhere else if I feel unsafe. At the same time, I speak with my American friends living in the Tel Aviv area. Their narrative is completely different - they hear rockets and military planes flying overhead, constantly worried by threat of attack. Instead of my usual Reddit and Hacker News, I am reading Haaretz and following Twitter. I hesitate to open Facebook to see what the disheartening posts are, from friends both local and abroad. I look around and see the misunderstanding between different groups, the disrespect, and the too-quick thinking that leads to potential escalation. 

I come to MEET every morning and I feel a simple need to do one thing: facilitate the need to take rational action. In the face of friends from the US encouraging me to go home, I feel that by staying I can use my skills to push the action in the right direction. I see the people on the streets and I see a glimmer of hope - there is action being taken. But what I feel an obligation to do is to make sure that the action is towards change, nonviolently. Now, more than ever, I understand that what MEET is doing is different. And I want to be a part of it.
