meta-post

Hey Michele,

As you probably saw on FB I started a travel blog recently. While writing up a post about Auschwitz and an Israeli band I saw at a concert, I realized that there are a lot of sensitive issues, and given my relative lack of knowledge, I wanted to be sure I wasn't making any blunders.

Along those lines, is there a policy or guidelines or even just suggestions you might have? I noticed you had some posts on your blog about the Middle East and also specifically about MEET.

Thanks,
Ramesh

Hi Ramesh - 

I finally have some time to think about responding to this email. It's a complicated question, but it's one that anyone who works in "conflict regions" or with people who come from backgrounds sensitive to particular historical events will have opinions about how to deal with this problem. 

You should absolutely write and blog about MEET, because that is the way MEET thrives - when it's message gets out, it is winning, in a sense. And the fact that you might be using particular language or discussing certain topics would mean that other people pay more attention to this as well.

The main takeaway I've had in my experience with this is that as long as you are respectful, you can do no wrong. As long as you don't call anyone names, make overarching accusations, or say things without proof, you can do no wrong. Of course, there is a lot loaded in that sentence, but for MEET specifically, there are a few pain points that I want to touch that you are aware of. This will also be discussed with you during the training week (hopefully. but then again, maybe not)

* The comparison between the groups of people we are working with is Palestinian and Israeli, NOT Palestinian and Jewish, and NOT Muslim and Jewish. It is Palestinian and Israeli. There are a few reasons for this: (1) they both represent belong to a group that is united by a national front. MEET takes the stance that Palestinians are a group and Israelis are a group. There are Muslims in the Israeli group, and believe it or not there are a few Jews in the Palestninian group. (2) by comparing Palestinian vs Israeli, we are not making this a battle of religions, but of ethnicity. Jewish is a religion (Jews will say it is an ethnicity, though, so be careful here), and Palestinian is a nationality, so comparing the two is not appropriate. Think of it this way: not all Jews are Israeli, and not all Israelis are Jews. Not all Muslims are Palestinians and not all Palestinians are Muslims - but the conflict is centered exactly between the people who say that the Israeli government supports them (i.e. Israelis) and those who say that the Palestinian governing bodies (whether that is Hamas or the PLO or the PA or anything else) represent them (i.e. Palestinians). 

* Places are contentious. Saying the word "Israel" to a person who lives in East Jerusalem is not particularly respectful, when you mean it to represent for example Jerusalem. To the person from East Jerusalem, he is in what he calls "Palestine" but what someone else might call "Israel." So when referencing places, use their city names, rather than the larger region. You can say West Bank, because that is a clear place, except when it is used to refer to the settlements around Jerusalem. You can say Israel, except sparingly, when you mean to refer to Yretz Israel, the country that the Israelis wanted to make for themselves. You can say Historical Palestine, because that is what this area was called during the British Mandate before 1922. But as a word of advice, I would stay away from using the words "Israel" and "Palestine" altogether. When we talk about Jerusalem, we don't say we are going to Jerusalem, Israel. We just say we are going to Jerusalem, or that we are going to "the region." It's much simpler that way. In short: city names, good; vague names, good; Israel, not good; Palestine, not good. 

* The rule above also counts for events. i.e. The Israeli War of Independence vs. the Nakba. Google that one and get lost in reading forever....

* History. Learn a bit about the history of some event or some place before you write about it. So if you're going to write about the Old City, read a little bit about who owns it, who claims they own it, what kinds of people live there, what happened there recently, why is it important for people. That will give you context about what is sensitive to talk about and what is not sensitive to talk about. 

* Inclusion - don't leave any side out. So when you are talking about the Old City, for instance, there is not only a Muslim Quarter and a Jewish Quarter (I can say that here because those are the names of those quarters), there is also a Christian Quarter and an Armenian Quarter. Don't just talk about the thing that people THINK the conflict is about - the Old City is also involved in conflict with Christians and Armenians (who are mostly Christian but some are Muslim). This is also important even when you talk about Israelis and Palestinians. Because there are Palestinian Citizens of Israel (i.e. what some people call Arab Israelis). They are Palestinians who have Israeli citizenship because they lived in lands that the Israelis conquered before the establishment of the state in 1948. There are also Druze, who's religion is closer to Islam than any other religion, but who serve in the Israeli army. There are also Bedouins who are Palestinians but are much more forgotten because their traditional life and religion is nomadic. In short, there are many dimensions, so at the very least, acknowledging all the dimensions is important whenever writing about two particular pieces of the same coin. 

* Identity. Make an effort to talk to people to find out what they call themselves, how they identify, and how they refer to places, events, or things. I say "Palestinian citizen of Israel" instead of "Israeli Arab" because (1) it is more correct (Palestinians are Arabs but Arabs are not Palestinians, so saying Israeli Arab is taking away from the Palestinian identity) and (2) because that is what people have told me to call them. Of course, there are others who say different things, so at some point you have to make your own opinion about exactly what phrases to use. But for myself personally, at least when I talk about these things I know that I am not offending my friends who I respect. 

* Bias. Be careful what pre-conceived biases you have about the conflict, and don't write about them. A helpful tip I've found is to write and then go over it with two lenses: pretending I am in a club in Tel Aviv versus in the the middle of Ramallah. The things I can't say in both places without risking having a stone thrown at me are taken out and rephrased. You're going to be shocked by how much the American media is pro-Israel - it's in your subconscious. Just be wary. 

* The Israeli army / mandatory military service. This one is a hairy one. For Israelis, this is a fact of what they have to do, and they often get good jobs because of it and their connections they make. To them, they don't see it as aggression towards anyone or as harmful - they just have to do it because that is what they are told. Palestinians see the Israeli army as unnecessary, oppressive, and over the top. They have a hard time understanding why their Israeli peers would serve in an army that they are told is destructive to their freedoms. Yes, Israel is a militarized society (I wouldn't publish that on a blog, because that is not the kind of thing that people agree with necessarily), and they have mandatory conscription. Palestinians are not allowed to HAVE an army. It is a clear sign of power dominance, and people take it as a point of fact, so it deserves a lot of mental energy to write about without offending anyone. 

* Language. The state of Israel has two official languages, Hebrew and Arabic. At MEET, not everyone speaks both, so to stay fair to everyone, we speak in English all the time. Of course, there are some cases where there is a specific word in a specific language that is necessary to use, but it absolutely needs to be explained in English so that everyone will understand. It is never the case that you speak in front of someone in a language they don't understand - that's just rude, so the same principle applies in a blog. 

I hope that helps a little bit - I tried to make the thoughts coherent, but they were a bit more messy than I hoped. I would write at the beginning of your experience and the end, but I wouldn't publish anything super early before you feel like you have a good grasp of all these issues.

Reply-all at Michele's request :P

"by comparing Palestinian vs Israeli, we are not making this a battle of religions, but of ethnicity"

Hah, I would assume you mean to say but of nationality. And not of ethnicity. I'd also say Jewish is both a religion and ethnicity, and "Arab" is perhaps the equivalent ethnicity? Words are hard

I.e. my personal understanding is grouping by nationality and not ethnicity (and not religion), and there are also many ethnicities in both the Palestinian/Israeli categories. But it's hard to deconstruct all these :)

Tim said, in response to Ted: 

That seems like a nice word for "Jewish" but not Israeli/Palestinian. Of course when we're dealing with socially constructed categories, what can we do :P
