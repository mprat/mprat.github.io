I spent the last year (roughly June 2013 - August 2014, with some small breaks) working in Jerusalem at [MEET](http://meet.mit.edu), a non-profit working with Israeli and Palestinian youth on computer science and entrepreneurship education.

My main responsibility was to teach all of the computer science content to all the students during the yearlong. But as every educator knows and loves, you can't just "teach" - you need to have a clear idea of what it is you want to teach. In other words, you need a solid curriculum. So my second main responsibility was to record and develop the MEET student curriculum, together with the MEET student program manager and two volunteers with expertise in entrepreneurship.

In this post, I want to address the constraints of the MEET student curriculum from external factors, both from an organizational standpoint and a situational standpoint. Then, I want to address the high-level goals set by the organizational structure of MEET. Next, I want to discuss the MEET student curriculum itself, from a content perspective. Then, I want to discuss metrics and assessments of success of the curriculum. Finally, I want to discuss the curriculum development process, together with offering suggestions for improvement in both the curriculum and the process in the future. 

## Curricular constraints on the MEET student program

MEET is a unique program within it's ecosystem. In Jerusalem, there are few cross-national programs, fewer cross-national programs targeting youth, and yet fewer cross-national programs targeting youth for long periods of time. What makes MEET stand out is that each student going through the MEET student program has 800 hours of interaction time with the program.

Operating inside Jerusalem targeting a cross-national population with differing school and holiday schedules means that the curriculum, let alone the program itself, needs to be resilient and robust in case of changes. While there is no such thing as a normal political situation in Jerusalem, there is always some tensions between the various ethnic groups that reside in the city. Sudden cancellation of sessions for city-wide events or holidays is also common, although avoided if possible.

### Structure of the MEET student program

The main constraint faced by the curriculum development team was the structure of the MEET program itself, developed by the board of directors and the MEET program staff over 11 years of operation. 

MEET students start with the program the summer after their first year of high school and end the summer before the final year of high school. In the summers, students spend about 3 weeks in an overnight program (called the summer program), and in the interstitial school years spend 3 hours a week in sessions (called the yearlong). All the sessions are conducted in English, the common language between all the students.
