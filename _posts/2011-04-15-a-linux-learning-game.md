#### The beginning: a class

This semester (Spring 2011) I took one of the most enjoyable classes I have ever taken at MIT: 11.127/CMS.590, or Educational Games, taught by [Professor Eric Klopfer](http://education.mit.edu/people/eric-klopfer) from the Urban Studies and Planning department. (Since then, the class has been renamed [Computer Games and Simulations for Education and Exploration](http://education.mit.edu/classes/11127).) The main goal of the class was to discuss and utilize gamification techniques to create games that were both educational and fun. 

#### Gamification

The idea behind gamification is simple. "Gamification" is the act of turning something into a game. When applied to education and learning, it is even simpler. You make something into a game, and learners find it more fun. Because learners find it more fun, they learn more. Although education and gaming experts disagree about exactly what constitutes gamification, a few sample characteristics are: 

- {: .detail-text} Competition (either with yourself or against others)
- {: .detail-text} Narrative (plot, characters)
- {: .detail-text} Exploration (giving the user interesting choice)
- {: .detail-text} Rewards (points, virtual currency, stars)
{: .detail-list}

Services like Foursquare thrive on the idea of gamification: you get points by checking in to a location and earning rewards. But less obvious examples are also elements of gamification. For example, Github's repository "stars": ![Github's stars on a repository for Terminus](/imgs/github_stars.png){: #github-stars} and Yelp's compliment icons: ![Yelp's compliment icons and badges](/imgs/yelp_compliments1.png){: #yelp-comp}
These icons and rewards give the user freedom to explore the possibilities of the environment, creating a persona for themselves in whichever way they choose, possibly competing against others for particular achievements. 

One easy way to gamify something boring is to relate it to something more fun. For example, in 

Terminus is an online text-based adventure game that teaches the player how to use terminal commands. The terminal and text-based adventure interfaces are very similar, making the transition from game to product more seamless than before. Gamification!
