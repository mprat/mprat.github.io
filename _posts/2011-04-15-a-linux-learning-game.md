#### The beginning: a class

This semester (Spring 2011) I took one of the most enjoyable classes I have ever taken at MIT: 11.127/CMS.590, or Educational Games, taught by Professor Eric Klopfer from the Urban Studies and Planning department. (Since then, the class has been renamed [Computer Games and Simulations for Education and Exploration](http://education.mit.edu/classes/11127).) The main goal of the class was to discuss and utilize gamification techniques to create games that were both educational and fun. 

#### Gamification

The idea behind gamification is simple. In general, gamification turns something into a game. When applied to education and learning, it is even simpler. You make something into a game, and learners find it more fun. Because learners find it more fun, they learn more. Although education and gaming experts disagree about exactly what constitutes gamification, a few sample characteristics are: 
- Competition (either with yourself or against others)
- Plot
- Characters
- Exploration
- Rewards (points, level-ups, stars)

Terminus is an online text-based adventure game that teaches the player how to use terminal commands. The terminal and text-based adventure interfaces are very similar, making the transition from game to product more seamless than before. Gamification!
