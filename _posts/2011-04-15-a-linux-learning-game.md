This semester (Spring 2011) I took one of the most enjoyable classes I have ever taken at MIT: 11.127/CMS.590, or Educational Games, taught by Professor Eric Klopfer from the Urban Studies and Planning department. (Since then, the class has been renamed [Computer Games and Simulations for Education and Exploration](http://education.mit.edu/classes/11127).)

Terminus is an online text-based adventure game that teaches the player how to use terminal commands. The terminal and text-based adventure interfaces are very similar, making the transition from game to product more seamless than before. Gamification! Project designed, coded, and decorated by Shawn Conrad, Michaela LaVan, Michele Pratusevich, Emma Tolley, David Zhou.
