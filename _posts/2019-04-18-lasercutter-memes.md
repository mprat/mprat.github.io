I recently got trained on the lasercutter at [Artisan's Asylum](http://artisansasylum.com/) and wanted to do a project! Thankfully, my friend [Emilie](https://www.emiliejosephs.com/) had just the project.

#### Memes

Memes (i.e. units of culture) have been on the internet for so long that some people are starting to print them out to share. I hear this is getting especially common in nursing homes or retirement communities, but I read that on the internet so I don't know.

What we did instead was etch a meme instead of print it out! It took a few tries to get all the etched settings right, but it turned out great. This involved importing the PNG into [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), tracing the bitmap, and cleaning it up to make a printable SVG.

#### The Final Product

Personally, I think it looks gorgeous:
