A first attempt was made in Java. It was pretty decent for a final project for a non-coding class. And it had sweet graphics.

#### Before you code: design! 

The name of your game can make or break your success. Fortunately, *Terminus* sounds sufficiently cool for being close to our metaphor, so our job there was done. The medium was also a no-brainer: the ideal metaphor is no metaphor at all. For us, because we were teaching terminal commands, it made the most sense for Terminus to be a computer game.

Before starting full-force on the development of the game, factors like the audience, basic mechanics, plot lines, and outstanding features need to be fleshed out to avoid unpleasantness later on. 

#### The Audience

Our target audience was high school and early college students. These were people who have use for knowing terminal commands, or are likely to be deciding whether they "get" or "don't get" computers at that age. We wanted to capture and engage the population that would benefit from learning the terminal - either to advance their chosen academic track or to move them towards a technical education. 

On one hand, this audience was an easy one, since we knew them well: we were in the same age group as our audience. On the other hand, this audience is a fickle one, hard to please and easily distracted. And yet another problem was that we did not exactly fall within our target audience, since most of us were already familiar with using the terminal. 

#### Game design 

A text-based adventure could only be successful if the gameplay, plot, and activities are engaging enough for the user. Our first big challenge was to create a storyline around the various terminal commands that was engaging enough for our target audience.

We settled on a basic gameplay that drew analogies between terminal concepts and fantastical experiences: 

| computer | abstraction |
|--:|:--|
| filesystem | a series of rooms|
| terminal commands | spells|
| the cursor | you, the main character|

#### Java is the chosen one

I was nearing the end of my sophomore year at MIT when the Terminus project started. At that point, I was not yet a declared computer science major. I had taken 6.01, MIT's introductory computer science class taught in very basic python, but the language I was most familiar with was Java. I had taken it in high school just 2-3 years before, and was taking 6.005, MIT's software development class taught in Java, that semester. 

11.127 was not a computer science class (by all MIT standards it was "a humanities class") and therefore deserved the best ratio of excellence to effort. Out of our group of five, it was decided that Shawn and I were going to be the main coders. Because I was less experienced, we chose Java as our language of choice - it would be easiest to code with the least amount of effort. 

Absolutely no thought was given to the distribution or audience of the game: we were going for pure ease of finishing. That's how our first version of Terminus ended up as a Java program. 

Back in the day before Github became cool, our code repository was hosted on MIT servers as a password-protected SVN repository. I have since uploaded the (decompiled Java) code to Github, but have lost all SVN commits and tags because of coding inexperience.
