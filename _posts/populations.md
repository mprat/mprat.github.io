_Disclaimer: Because I have not been classically trained in sociology, I am going to use the word "ethnic group" to refer to a group of peoples that share a culture, upbringing, and set of values. This is inconsistent with the academic definition of ethnic group, but for the purposes of this piece, I want to define my terms very carefully._

I hate counting. I was a mathematics major in college (I ended up graduating with a degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics), and yet I still hate counting. When you have a variable, it stands for "a quantity", but when you count something, you are then held accountable for that number.

The most obvious error I have ever made in this case came from my year abroad in Jerusalem. I am not a religious person - I was working for an NGO doing computer science and entrepreneurship education for high-achieving Israeli and Palestinian youth. [MEET](http://meet.mit.edu), as this program was called, always said in it's publicity and external relation materials, that it was a bi-national program based in Jerusalem. Of course, it also said that it was catering towards Israeli and Palestinian youth, and that is what most people though of while interacting with MEET. But there is more nuance to that picture.

Bi-national is a simplification. It is easy to understand at a high level, and is correct to a point. For those who know more context, bi-national is too simple.

The idea of a nationality is complex. While the words nationality, citizenship, ethnic group, peoples, etc. all refer to the same general concept, the subtleties of each of these words are lost to the casual reader.

DEFINE SOME OF THESE WORDS

Segmenting a population into two halves is dangerous business. As soon as you try to label a person into one of two categories, you will inevitably make mistakes. Humans are the masters of inventing the gradient or the scale. Take the simple example of a religion. Categorizing myself into a religious bucket is easy - I am not religious. But am I Christian? My father's family is not; my mother's family is. When I was a baby, I slept with a Virgin Mary icon in my bedroom; we don't use it any more. We have never been to church; I have never had a confirmation (even if I were considered religious, I wouldn't have to because the Orthodox faith does not have this idea of confirmations or communions).  Am I Jewish? My father's family has Jewish roots; my mother's does not. We have a menorah in our house; we don't use it. We have never been to a congregation; I never had a bat mitzvah. By most strict religious standards, I am not Jewish. But by Israeli law, I am in fact considered Jewish, since more than one out of my 4 grandparents are Jewish. I do not consider myself neither Jewish nor Christian - I am neither. It is dangerous to pick one of only two options.

MEET claims it is a bi-national organization. It operates in Jerusalem and Nazareth, populated by a number of radically different cultural groups. There are religious Mizrahi Israeli Jews. Religious Sephardic Israeli Jews. Not-religious-but-very-cultural Israeli Jews of both origins, atheist Israeli Jews, Christian Palestinians with Israeli citizenship, Christian Palestinians without an Israeli citizenship but with a Jerusalem residency, Muslim Palestinians with Israeli citizenship, Muslim Palestinians with only a Jerusalem residency, atheist Palestinians who are societally pressured to adopt either the Christian or Muslim norms, and every other possible person in any spectrum or combination I haven't mentioned. Perhaps MEET is a bi-national organization, but there is much more nuance. 

As an "outsider" to the MEET ecosystem (I am neither Israeli or Palestinian), it is easy for me to imagine how the entire population of this little strip of "Holy Land" is partitioned into two pieces: Israeli and Palestinian. It is a classic case of "them against us", from whichever side you happen to be perched from. 

Sure, there are differences between the "sides", but there are overlaps between pieces of the sides that are more similar than the differences between "all Israelis" and "all Palestinians" that is scary to make. And we start to make these assumptions from the start of the battle - from the way we name the two groups. 

Consider the simple example of the Palestinian citizens of Israel. In school from the age of 5, they learn Hebrew in parallel with Arabic in a formal setting. By the time they reach high school, they are as proficient at Hebrew as many of the bilingual or recently-emigrated Israeli schoolchildren their age. During casual conversation between a Palestinian citizen of Israel and an Israeli, the common language might easily be Hebrew rather than English, as is proposed by MEET. While the content of what I teach and the activities I do are not changed by this fact, the way the students interact in their free time might. One place MEET succeeds at is requiring English as the common language between all students, as one way for putting everyone on level ground, to exactly combat this potential effect.

When explaining MEET to someone who doesn't know it (or maybe doesn't know anything about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict other than the fact that it is a conflict), it is impossible to explain these nuances. Let's get people involved in MEET and make sure they ask the right questions about the nuances as part of their personal growth and involvement with MEET.

There are more narratives than two - there always are. There is always a spectrum of narratives. MEET simplifies, and that's OK. Let's just acknowledge that and understand that we are all on a spectrum. For those that get more involved with MEET, this spectrum becomes more apparent and interesting. The bi-national oversimplification is there for a reason, and that's OK.
