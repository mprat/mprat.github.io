EECSCon is happening this coming Saturday! I made a poster describing my SuperUROP work on mobile rephotography. Check out my poster <a class="text_link" href="/docs/rephotography.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>! If you don't want to look at the PDF, parts of the poster are reproduced below as images.

EECSCon itself was an interesting experience. It was the first time I had to make a poster about academic "research" work. Putting together all of my thoughts without going into the technical details was quite a challenge, but luckily I was working on a graphics-and-computer-vision project, so I had lots of images I could show.
