Always looking for an excuse (read: money) to continue working on my various projects, I decided that the Terminus project from 11.127 so long ago would be a great entry for the [MIT iCampus Prize Competition](http://icampusprize.mit.edu/) in the spring of 2013. The original idea for submitting to this competition came from the [Education Designathon](http://www.edudesignathon.com/) held at MIT in spring 2013. 

#### the education designathon

I have always loved education - as a system, as a problem, as a project. However, I've had a hard time thinking of ways I can use my computer science training to help with education (sure, MOOCs, but I haven't yet decided whether those are beneficial for education or not). In either case, when I got an email from Jessica Artilles advertising the designathon, I was super excited. 

A "designathon" instead of a "hackathon" that promised to bring together education experts and technologists alike was going to be exciting. 

At the designathon of course I started working on a problem but soon realized that it was already solved. So to my luck, I found Shawn (yes, original Terminus group member Shawn!) at the designathon too and we decided we wanted to continue with Terminus.

#### the competition

Whenever you re-appropriate a project for a competition or a cause, it is criticl to again understand the audience. In this case, the iCampus prize is a competition to create products that improve MIT campus life.

The reasoning goes like this: MIT's computing system (called Athena) is built on top of Ubuntu Linux. The majority of undergraduates, when they first get to campus,

Making it to the semifinals of the MIT iCampus Prize Competition in spring 2013, Terminus provides a solution to a freshman problem at MIT: the computing environment is Ubuntu Linux, and there are many custom commands on the MIT Debathena Computing system that incoming freshmen are not familiar with. By playing Terminus, they can become more familiar with both the command-line environment and the MIT computing environment.
