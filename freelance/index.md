I am available for freelance engineering work or hourly consulting. Please reach out via email (mprat@alum.mit.edu) or LinkedIn, and I will get back to you promptly.

Hourly consulting is geared towards software engineering leaders interested in brainstorming solutions to software systems problems. As the first software hire at Root AI (who then got acquired by AppHarvest two years later) I designed and built the software (and firmware) systems powering an autonomous mobile robot. I collaborated across disciplines (electrical, mechanical, product) to solidify requirements and deliverables at all stages: prototype, fundraise, deployment. As the team grew, the software system I designed was used (and modified where needed) to task software, firmware, machine learning, deployment, mechanical, and electrical teams to improve the system at all levels. Multiple robots were deployed around the world in multiple locations. I served as the director of software and autonomous systems, overseeing a team of 5 engineers, before I left the company.

Prior to that, I was an applied scientist at Amazon working on the Amazon Go and Dash Cart projects. Many of my projects were short-lived (as is the goal of applied science!), and the ones that survived ultimately made it into production.

The contrast of my experience at a tech giant and a small startup, as an IC and a manager, in projects that require software working with hardware, give me a breadth of examples for what to do and what not to do. Let me help!
